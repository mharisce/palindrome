{"name":"Palindrome Generator","tagline":"This project is a Palindrome Generator Library written in JAVA.  Currently, it is the fastest palindrome generator library available. It generates next palindrome within O(l/2) where l = length of the palindrome string. Also it generates the next palindrome from a given starting string in the same time. It does not bound you with the set of alphabet. You can provide an alphabet which JAVA String class accepts. Please explore for further knowledge. Also it contains some utility functions like palindrome detection etc.","body":"# Welcome to Palindrome Generator\r\nThis project is a Palindrome Generator Library written in JAVA.
